            Antarctica only has two seasons: summer and winter. Because it's located in the southern hemisphere, Antarctica's summer is from October to February. During this time, the sun is almost always in the sky. Days rapidly get longer there in summer, until, eventually, the sun doesn't set at all. This phenomenon is called the Midnight Sun.
            January is the warmest month in Antarctica, during which average temperatures climb all the way up to 0 degrees in the Antarctic Peninsula. However, the average temperatures ranges from -10 degrees celcius to -60 degrees, depending on how far into the continent you travel.
