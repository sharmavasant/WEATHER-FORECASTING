            Spring and autumn is when the temperature contrast is the least, being somewhat hot during the day and slightly cool at night.

Summer is when the heat is the most intense, sometimes exceeding 40 degrees (100 Fahrenheit) during the day, being somewhat cooler at night.

Winter is the coldest and most humid, and you’ll need shelter for the cold night, although during the day the temperature is pleasant.

The source is the statistical data collected in recent years in Merzouga-Erg Chebbi, which can be extrapolated to any area of the Sahara desert (for example, in M’Hamid-Erg Chegaga the temperature varies approximately one degree with respect to what is described here):
